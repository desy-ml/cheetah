Welcome to Cheetah's documentation!
===================================

`Cheetah <https://github.com/desy-ml/cheetah>`_ is a particle tracking accelerator we built specifically to speed up the training of reinforcement learning models.

Installation
------------

Simply install *Cheetah* from PyPI by running the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cheetah-accelerator


Examples
--------

We provide some examples to demonstrate some features of *Cheetah* and show how to use them. They provide a good entry point to using *Cheetah*, but they do not represent its full functionality. To move beyond the examples, please refer to the in-depth documentation. If you feel like other examples should be added, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.

For Developers
--------------

Activate your virtual environment. (Optional)

Install the cheetah package as editable

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install -e .

We suggest installing pre-commit hooks to automatically conform with the code formatting in commits:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
