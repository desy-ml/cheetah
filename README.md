# Cheetah

<img src="https://github.com/desy-ml/cheetah/raw/master/images/logo.png" align="right" width="25%"/>

Cheetah is a high-speed differentiable beam dynamics code specifically design to support machine learning applications for particle accelerators.

Its speed helps generate data fast, for example for extremely data-hungry reinforcement learning algorithms, while its differentiability can be used for a variety of applications, including accelerator tuning, system identification and physics-informed prior means for Bayesian optimisation. Its native integration with machine learning toolchains around PyTorch also makes Cheetah an ideal candidate for coupling of physics-based and neural network beam dynamics models that remain fast and differentiable.

To learn more about what Cheetah can do, we recommend reading our [PRAB paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.27.054601). To learn how to use Cheetah, we refer to the example notebooks in the [Cheetah documentation](https://cheetah-accelerator.readthedocs.io/). We also have a public [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7k7kzSDwpn) where you can ask questions and get help.

## Installation

Simply install _Cheetah_ from PyPI by running the following command.

```bash
pip install cheetah-accelerator
```

## How To Use

**You can run the following example in Binder by clicking [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/desy-ml/cheetah.git/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fdocs%2Fexamples%2Fsimple.ipynb) or on the badge above.**

In this example, we create a custom lattice and track a beam through it. We start with some imports.

```python
import cheetah
import torch
```

Lattices in _Cheetah_ are represented by `Segments`. A `Segment` is created as follows.

```python
segment = cheetah.Segment(
    elements=[
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.175)),
        cheetah.Quadrupole(length=torch.tensor(0.122), name="AREAMQZM1"),
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.428)),
        cheetah.Quadrupole(length=torch.tensor(0.122), name="AREAMQZM2"),
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.204)),
        cheetah.VerticalCorrector(length=torch.tensor(0.02), name="AREAMCVM1"),
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.204)),
        cheetah.Quadrupole(length=torch.tensor(0.122), name="AREAMQZM3"),
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.179)),
        cheetah.HorizontalCorrector(length=torch.tensor(0.02), name="AREAMCHM1"),
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.45)),
        cheetah.Screen(name="AREABSCR1"),
    ]
)
```

Alternatively you can load lattices from Cheetah's variant of LatticeJSON or convert them from an Ocelot cell

```python
lattice_json_segment = cheetah.Segment.from_lattice_json("lattice_file.json")
segment = cheetah.Segment.from_ocelot(cell)
```

**Note** that many values must be passed to lattice elements as `torch.Tensor`s. This is because _Cheetah_ uses automatic differentiation to compute the gradient of the beam position at the end of the lattice with respect to the element strengths. This is necessary for gradient-based magnet setting optimisation.

Named lattice elements (i.e. elements that were given a `name` keyword argument) can be accessed by name and their parameters changed like so.

```python
segment.AREAMQZM1.k1 = torch.tensor(8.2)
segment.AREAMQZM2.k1 = torch.tensor(-14.3)
segment.AREAMCVM1.angle = torch.tensor(9e-5)
segment.AREAMQZM3.k1 = torch.tensor(3.142)
segment.AREAMCHM1.angle = torch.tensor(-1e-4)
```

Cheetah has two different beam classes: `ParticleBeam` and `ParameterBeam`. The former tracks multiple individual macroparticles for high-fidelity results, while the latter tracks the parameters of a particle distribution to save on compute time and memory.

You can create a beam manually by specifying the beam parameters of a Gaussian distributed beam

```python
parameter_beam = cheetah.ParameterBeam.from_twiss(beta_x=torch.tensor(3.14))
particle_beam = cheetah.ParticleBeam.from_twiss(
    beta_x=torch.tensor(3.14), beta_y=torch.tensor(42.0), num_particles=10_000
)
```

or load beams from other codes and standards, including openPMD, Ocelot and Astra.

```python
astra_beam = cheetah.ParticleBeam.from_astra(
    "../../tests/resources/ACHIP_EA1_2021.1351.001"
)
```

In order to track a beam through the segment, simply call the segment's `track` method.

```python
outgoing_beam = segment.track(astra_beam)
```

You may plot a segment with reference particle traces by calling

```python
segment.plot_overview(incoming=astra_beam, resolution=0.05)
```

![Overview Plot](https://github.com/desy-ml/cheetah/raw/master/images/readme_overview_plot.png)

where the keyword argument `incoming` is the incoming beam represented by the reference particles.

You can also visualise your segment in 3D. **Note** that this requires that you installed Cheetah as `pip install cheetah-accelerator[3d-visualization]`.

Use `mesh.show` to view the mesh and `mesh.export` to export it to a file.

```python
mesh, _ = segment.to_mesh(
    cuteness={cheetah.HorizontalCorrector: 2.0, cheetah.VerticalCorrector: 2.0}
)
mesh.show()
```

![Animated Mesh](https://github.com/desy-ml/cheetah/raw/master/images/animated_mesh.gif)

```python
mesh.export(file_obj="my_first_cheetah_mesh.glb", file_type="glb")
```
