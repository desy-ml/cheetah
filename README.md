# Cheetah

<img src="https://github.com/desy-ml/cheetah/raw/master/images/logo.png" align="right" width="25%"/>

Cheetah is a high-speed differentiable beam dynamics code specifically design to support machine learning applications for particle accelerators.

Its speed helps generate data fast, for example for extremely data-hungry reinforcement learning algorithms, while its differentiability can be used for a variety of applications, including accelerator tuning, system identification and physics-informed prior means for Bayesian optimisation. Its native integration with machine learning toolchains around PyTorch also makes Cheetah an ideal candidate for coupling of physics-based and neural network beam dynamics models that remain fast and differentiable.

To learn more about what Cheetah can do, we recommend reading our [PRAB paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.27.054601). To learn how to use Cheetah, we refer to the example notebooks in the [Cheetah documentation](https://cheetah-accelerator.readthedocs.io/). We also have a public [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7k7kzSDwpn) where you can ask questions and get help.

## Installation

Simply install _Cheetah_ from PyPI by running the following command.

```bash
pip install cheetah-accelerator
```

## How To Use

**You can run the following example in Binder by clicking [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/desy-ml/cheetah.git/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fdocs%2Fexamples%2Fsimple.ipynb) or on the badge above.**

A sequence of accelerator elements (or a lattice) is called a `Segment` in _Cheetah_. You can create a `Segment` as follows

```python
import cheetah
import torch

segment = cheetah.Segment(
    elements=[
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.175)),
        cheetah.Quadruple(length=torch.tensor(0.122), name="AREAMQZM1"),
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.428)),
        cheetah.Quadruple(length=torch.tensor(0.122), name="AREAMQZM2"),
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.204)),
        cheetah.VerticalCorrector(length=torch.tensor(0.02), name="AREAMCVM1"),
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.204)),
        cheetah.Quadruple(length=torch.tensor(0.122), name="AREAMQZM3"),
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.179)),
        cheetah.HorizontalCorrector(length=torch.tensor(0.02), name="AREAMCHM1"),
        cheetah.Drift(length=torch.tensor(0.45)),
        cheetah.Screen(name="AREABSCR1"),
    ]
)
```

Alternatively you can create a segment from an Ocelot cell by running

```python
segment = cheetah.Segment.from_ocelot(cell)
```

All elements can be accesses as a property of the segment via their name. The strength of a quadrupole named _AREAMQZM2_ for example, may be set by running

```python
segment.AREAMQZM2.k1 = torch.tensor(4.2)
```

You can choose to track either a beam defined by its parameters (fast) or by its particles (precise). _Cheetah_ defines two different beam classes for this purpose and beams may be created by

```python
parameter_beam = cheetah.ParameterBeam.from_twiss(beta_x=torch.tensor(3.14))
particle_beam = cheetah.ParticleBeam.from_twiss(
    beta_x=torch.tensor(3.14), num_particles=10_000
)
```

It is also possible to load beams from Ocelot `ParticleArray` or Astra particle distribution files for both types of beam

```python
ocelot_beam = cheetah.ParticleBeam.from_ocelot(parray)
astra_beam = cheetah.ParticleBeam.from_astra(filepath)
```

In order to track a beam through the segment, simply call the segment like so

```python
outgoing_beam = segment.track(astra_beam)
```

You may plot a segment with the beam position and size by calling

```python
segment.plot_overview(incoming=beam)
```

![Overview Plot](https://github.com/desy-ml/cheetah/raw/master/images/readme_overview_plot.png)

where the keyword argument `incoming` is the incoming beam represented in the plot.

## For Developers

Activate your virtual environment. (Optional)

Install the `cheetah` package as editable

```sh
pip install -e .
```

We suggest installing pre-commit hooks to automatically conform with the code formatting in commits:

```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
