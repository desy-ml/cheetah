# Changelog

## v0.7.1 [üöß Work in Progress]

### üö® Breaking Changes

- The `incoming` argument of `Segment.plot_overview` is no longer optional. This change also affects the order of the arguments. Fixes an exception that was raised by an underlying plot function that requires `incoming` to be set. (see #316) (@Hespe)
- Python 3.9 is no longer supported. This does not immediately break existing code, but might cause it to break in the future. (see #325) (@jank324)
- The covariance properties of the different beam classes were renamed from names like `cor_x` and `sigma_xpx` to consistent names like `cov_xpx` (see #331) (@jank324)

### üöÄ Features

- `ParticleBeam` now supports importing from and exporting to [openPMD-beamphysics](https://github.com/ChristopherMayes/openPMD-beamphysics) HDF5 files and `ParticleGroup` objects. This allows for easy conversion to and from other file formats supported by openPMD-beamphysics. (see #305, #320) (@cr-xu, @Hespe)
- Add `marker`, `quadrupole` and `csbend` element names to the Elegant converter (see #327) (@jank324)
- Add Python 3.13 support (see #275) (@jank324)
- Methods `to_parameter_beam` and `to_particle_beam` have been added for convenient conversion between `ParticleBeam` and `ParameterBeam` (see #331) (@jank324)
- Beam classes now have the `mu_tau` and `mu_p` properties on their interfaces (see #331) (@jank324)

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fix issue where a space before a comma could cause the Elegant and Bmad converters to fail (see #327) (@jank324)

### üêÜ Other

- The tests for backward-mode differentiation with space charge was improved, by checking the accuracy of the gradients (see #339) (@RemiLehe)
- A tests for forward-mode differentiation with space charge was added (see #339) (@RemiLehe)
- Test tolerances were adjusted reduce the chance of random test failures (see #309, #324) (@Hespe, @jank324)

- Add TUHH logo to contributing institution logos (see #338) (@jank324)
- Doc: ImpactX Example (Space Charge) #341 (@ax3l)

## [v0.7.0](https://github.com/desy-ml/cheetah/releases/tag/v0.7.0) (2024-12-13)

We are proud to announce this new major release of Cheetah! This is probably the biggest release since the original Cheetah release, with many with significant upgrades under the hood. Cheetah is now fully vectorised and compatible with PyTorch broadcasting rules, while additional physics and higher fidelity options for existing physics have also been introduced. Despite extensive testing, you might still encounter a few bugs. Please report them by opening an issue, so we can fix them as soon as possible and improve the experience for everyone.

### üö® Breaking Changes

- Cheetah is now vectorised. This means that you can run multiple simulations in parallel by passing a batch of beams and settings, resulting a number of interfaces being changed. For Cheetah developers this means that you now have to account for an arbitrary-dimensional tensor of most of the properties of you element, rather than a single value, vector or whatever else a property was before. (see #116, #157, #170, #172, #173, #198, #208, #213, #215, #218, #229, #233, #258, #265, #284, #291) (@jank324, @cr-xu, @Hespe, @roussel-ryan)
- As part of the vectorised rewrite, the `Aperture` no longer removes particles. Instead, `ParticleBeam.survival_probabilities` tracks the probability that a particle has survived (i.e. the inverse probability that it has been lost). This also comes with the removal of `Beam.empty`. Note that particle losses in `Aperture` are currently not differentiable. This will be addressed in a future release. (see #268) (@cr-xu, @jank324)
- The fifth particle coordinate `s` is renamed to `tau`. Now Cheetah uses the canonical variables in phase space $(x,px=\frac{P_x}{p_0},y,py, \tau=c\Delta t, \delta=\Delta E/{p_0 c})$. In addition, the trailing "s" was removed from some beam property names (e.g. `beam.xs` becomes `beam.x`). (see #163, #284) (@cr-xu, @Hespe)
- `Screen` no longer blocks the beam (by default). To return to old behaviour, set `Screen.is_blocking = True`. (see #208) (@jank324, @roussel-ryan)
- The way `dtype`s are determined is now more in line with PyTorch's conventions. This may cause different-than-expected `dtype`s in old code. (see #254) (@Hespe, @jank324)
- `Beam.parameters()` no longer shadows `torch.nn.Module.parameters()`. The previously returned properties now need to be queried individually. (see #300) (@Hespe)
- `e1` and `e2` in `Dipole` and `RBend` have been renamed and made more consistent between the different magnet types. They now have prefixes `dipole_` and `rbend_` respectively. (see #289) (@Hespe, @jank324)
- The `_transfer_map` property of `CustomTransferMap` has been renamed to `predefined_transfer_map`. (see #289) (@Hespe, @jank324)

### üöÄ Features

- `CustomTransferMap` elements created by combining multiple other elements will now reflect that in their `name` attribute (see #100) (@jank324)
- Add a new class method for `ParticleBeam` to generate a 3D uniformly distributed ellipsoidal beam (see #146) (@cr-xu, @jank324)

- Implement space charge using Green's function in a `SpaceChargeKick` element (see #142) (@greglenerd, @RemiLehe, @ax3l, @cr-xu, @jank324)
- `Segment`s can now be imported from Bmad to devices other than `torch.device("cpu")` and dtypes other than `torch.float32` (see #196, #206) (@jank324)
- `Screen` now offers the option to use KDE for differentiable images (see #200) (@cr-xu, @roussel-ryan)
- Moving `Element`s and `Beam`s to a different `device` and changing their `dtype` like with any `torch.nn.Module` is now possible (see #209) (@jank324)
- `Quadrupole` now supports tracking with Cheetah's matrix-based method or with Bmad's more accurate method (see #153) (@jp-ga, @jank324)
- Port Bmad-X tracking methods to Cheetah for `Quadrupole`, `Drift`, and `Dipole` (see #153, #240) (@jp-ga, @jank324)
- Add `TransverseDeflectingCavity` element (following the Bmad-X implementation) (see #240, #278 #296) (@jp-ga, @cr-xu, @jank324)
- `Dipole` and `RBend` now take a focusing moment `k1` (see #235, #247) (@Hespe)
- Implement a converter for lattice files imported from Elegant (see #222, #251, #273, #281) (@Hespe, @jank324)
- `Beam` and `Element` objects now have a `.clone()` method to create a deep copy (see #289) (@Hespe, @jank324)
- `ParticleBeam` now comes with methods for plotting the beam distribution in a variety of ways (see #292) (@roussel-ryan, @jank324)

### üêõ Bug fixes
